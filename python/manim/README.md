# Manim - Mathematical Animations

This folder contains Python lessons using **Manim** (Mathematical Animation Engine) to create beautiful mathematical visualizations!

## ðŸŽ¬ What is Manim?

Manim is a Python library created by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) that lets you create mathematical animations and videos. It's perfect for making abstract math concepts come to life!

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Manim for Learning?

- **Visual learning** - See math concepts in motion
- **Interactive** - Experiment with different parameters
- **Engaging** - Animations capture attention better than static images
- **Mathematical thinking** - Develop spatial reasoning skills
- **Creative coding** - Combine programming with mathematical art

## ðŸ“š Planned Lessons

- **Introduction to Manim** - Basic setup and simple animations
- **Geometric Transformations** - Rotations, scaling, translations
- **Function Visualization** - Plotting curves and surfaces
- **Mathematical Concepts** - Fractions, percentages, ratios with visual aids
- **Interactive Animations** - User-controlled mathematical objects

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Install Manim: `pip install manim`
2. Start with the introduction lesson
3. Experiment with the examples
4. Create your own mathematical animations!

## ðŸ’¡ Perfect for Grade 5 Students

- **Concrete-pictorial-abstract approach** - matches Singapore Math methodology
- **Hands-on learning** - code and see immediate visual results
- **Problem-solving focus** - encourages mathematical thinking
- **Creative expression** - makes math fun and engaging

Happy animating! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
