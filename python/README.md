# Python Learning Files

This folder contains Python programming lessons and examples for kids!

## 📚 Lessons

### Lesson 1: GCD and LCM
**Files:**
- `lesson1_gcd_lcm.py` - Complete lesson with explanations, examples, and interactive calculator
- `lesson1_test_gcd_lcm.py` - Practice test file for implementing your own functions

**What you'll learn:**
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) - 最大公约数
- Least Common Multiple (LCM) - 最小公倍数
- Euclidean Algorithm for efficient GCD calculation
- Mathematical relationships between numbers

**How to use:**
1. **Study the lesson:** Run `python lesson1_gcd_lcm.py` to learn concepts
2. **Practice coding:** Edit `lesson1_test_gcd_lcm.py` to implement your own functions
3. **Test your code:** Run `python lesson1_test_gcd_lcm.py` to verify your solutions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to this folder
4. Start with the lesson file, then try the test file

## 💡 Learning Approach

- **Learn by doing:** Read the lesson, then implement the functions yourself
- **Test your understanding:** Use the test files to verify your code works
- **Experiment:** Try different numbers and see what happens
- **Don't give up:** Programming takes practice - keep trying!

Happy coding! 🐍✨
